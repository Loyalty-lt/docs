## Authentication Methods

The API supports multiple authentication methods depending on your use case:

### API Credentials
For server-to-server integrations and trusted applications:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://staging-api.loyalty.lt/api/customers" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -H "X-API-Secret: your_api_secret"
```

### JWT Tokens  
For user sessions and frontend applications:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://staging-api.loyalty.lt/api/customer/profile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token"
```

<Check>
All API endpoints use HTTPS encryption and support CORS for browser-based applications.
</Check>

## Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage and optimal performance, the API implements rate limiting:

| Authentication Method | Requests per Minute | Burst Limit |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| API Credentials       | 1000              | 1500        |
| JWT Tokens           | 300               | 500         |
| Unauthenticated      | 60                | 100         |

<Tip>
Include the `X-RateLimit-*` headers in your responses to monitor your current usage and avoid hitting limits.
</Tip>
